SIL Ethiopic Keyboard
=============================

Copyright (C) SIL Ethiopia

Version 2.0

The “SIL Ethipoic” keyboard was developed to input Ethiopic Fidel scripts.  This keyboard is designed to work with the Abyssinica SIL font (version 1.500). However, unless you need to use the newest Unicode 6.0 Ethiopic codepoints (for Basketo, Gumuz and Gamo-Gofa-Dawro) or the Private Use Area (PUA) characters in this font, you can use this keyboard with any Ethiopic Unicode font.
