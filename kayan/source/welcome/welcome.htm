<h1>Welcome to the Kayǎn Keyboard</h1>

<h2>Key sequences</h2>
<p>First type the vowel and then the vowel change marks and then the tone marks after the vowel.</p>

<h2>Fonts</h2>
<p>There is a problem with many fonts not stacking diacritics correctly.</p>
<p>Charis SIL displays all the stacked diacritics correctly except the U+0300 and U+0301 sequence. We are waiting for a solution from SIL's NRSI deparment. In the mean time, we've changed ; to U+02CA.
